A brief describution of the simulation(1).

Planet population: KeplerLike2
Population based on Kepler radius distribution with RV-like semi-major axis distribution with exponential decay.

OpticalSystem: Nemati
Optical system model based on
Nemati, Bijan (2014) Detector selection for the WFIRST-AFTA coronagraph integral field spectrograph, Proc. SPIE, 91430
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9143E..0QN/abstract

StarCatalog: EXOCAT-1
EXOCAT-1 star catalog, 2347 nearby stars within 30pc
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv151001731T/abstract

ZodiacalLight: Stark
Zoducal light model based on
Stark, C., Roberge, A., Mandell, A., and Robinson, T. D. (2014) Maximizing the ExoEarth Candidate Yield from a Future Direct Imaging Mission, ApJ 795(2)

PlanetPhysicalModel: FortneyMarleyCahoyMix1
Planet density models based on Fortney & Marley, albedo models based on Cahoy. Intended for use with the Kepler-like planet population modules. The calculation of albedo is based solely on the semi-major axis and uses a uniform distribution of metallicities to interpolate albedo from the grid in Cahoy et al. 2010.
